In the process of making this application I didn't have much trouble with different browsers, only the gradient border didn't work at first in Firefox but I got it to work. I tested in 3 different browsers: Chrome, Firefox and Opera.

I think the responsive design turned out OK. I tried to do a sliding animation on the navigation "slider" when it appears but failed doing so. I may implement it another time.

I tried hard to prepare the website for the second phase so I rendered HTML with JSON responses and it turned out it works great, but the code got a bit messy and should be refactored a bit before going on to building the backend. I may use a templating engine to make things easier, since we're allowed to in the second phase of the project.
